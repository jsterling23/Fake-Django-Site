               <ul>
                    <li>Creating a blog post unique to user</li>
                    <li>User can only perform CRUD operations unique to user posts</li>
                    <li>Current user can see other user posts and "like" them which in turn adds the post to a "favorites" section. When favorited, it will remove it from the list of possible blog posts to 'like'</li>
                    <li>Then when "unliked" it will be removed from "favorites" section and added back to pool of user blog posts</li>
               </ul>
          </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<hr>
<p>I had fun with this and I will most likely go back and play around with concepts and ideas. Currently working on some features that could give this a boost.</p>
